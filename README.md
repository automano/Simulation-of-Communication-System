# Simulation-of-Communication-System
This Project is a simple simulation of the communication system.
HW#1 uses Huffman Encoding translate an article from NY time into the binery format.
HW#2 mainly focus on error correction. Determine the percentage of the symbols in error in the NY Times article. These percentages will show the effectiveness of your transmitter. 
HW#3 is about Phsical Signal Mapping. In the baseband signaling step, the chanel-encoded bits are mapped to physical signals that can be transmitted into the channel.
HW#4 use the physical signals generated from the last assignments.  Design the optimal filters for the three different physical signals received, each of which is based on one of the three constellations.
